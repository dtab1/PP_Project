WHen you set up SSH, you will need to generate a new private SSH key to add it to the SSH agent. 
In addition, you must add the public SSH key to your account on GitHub before you use the key to authenticate or sign commits. 


Using the SSH protocol may enable one to connect & authenticate to remote servers and services.
With SSH keys, one can connect to GitHub without supplying ones username & personal access token at each visit. 
One can also use SSH keys to sign commits.
